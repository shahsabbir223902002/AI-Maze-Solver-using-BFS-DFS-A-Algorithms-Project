# AI Maze Solver using BFS, DFS & A* Algorithms
A Python maze solver that finds paths in a maze using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **A* Search Algorithm**.

# About the Project
This project implements classic search algorithms to find the optimal (or any valid) path from the start to the goal in a 2D maze. It’s a practical application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) search techniques.

# Features
Solve a maze using:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – finds the shortest path in an unweighted maze. 
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – explores deep paths first.  
- **A* Algorithm** – uses heuristics for efficient shortest path finding.
