# Project Explanation

This project is an interactive AI Maze Solver built using Python and Pygame. It visually demonstrates how different search algorithms—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A*—find a path from a start point to an end point inside a maze.
The maze is represented as a grid where each cell can be empty, a wall, visited, or part of the final path. Users can run any algorithm using on-screen buttons and watch the step-by-step exploration in real time. The visualization speed can be adjusted (Fast, Medium, Slow), and start/end positions can be randomized to compare algorithm behavior under different conditions.

# This project helps in understanding:

-How search algorithms explore a state space

-Differences between uninformed (BFS, DFS) and informed (A*) search

-Pathfinding efficiency and execution time through visual feedback

The application is designed for learning, demonstration, and academic purposes in Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms courses.

# AI Maze Solver using BFS, DFS & A* Algorithms
A Python maze solver that finds paths in a maze using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **A* Search Algorithm**.

# About the Project
This project implements classic search algorithms to find the optimal (or any valid) path from the start to the goal in a 2D maze. It’s a practical application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) search techniques.

# Features
Solve a maze using:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – finds the shortest path in an unweighted maze. 
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – explores deep paths first.  
- **A* Algorithm** – uses heuristics for efficient shortest path finding.
